# Project Roadmap

## Development Standards TODO: clean this up by asking if we need both

For detailed development guidelines, refer to `.cursor/rules/development.md`.
All development standards are enforced through the cursor rules files in `.cursor/rules/`. 
This includes:
- Frontend and backend standards
- Package manager requirements (pnpm)
- Environment variables
- Project structure
- Dependencies and versions
- Command execution


## Incremental Build Process

This project is designed to be built in phases, each adding functionality while maintaining stability:

### Phase 1: Basic Setup and News Fetching
```markdown
Using the specifications from .cursor/rules/development.md, create a full-stack news aggregator with Next.js 14 (frontend) and FastAPI (backend). For this first phase:

Frontend requirements:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Basic article grid layout
- Loading and error states
- Simple article card component

Backend requirements:
- FastAPI setup with NewsAPI integration
- Basic article model
- Single endpoint: GET /api/news
- Error handling

Focus on:
- Clean project structure
- Type safety
- Basic error handling
- Working article fetching and display
```

### Phase 2: State Management and User Features
```markdown
Enhance the news aggregator with state management and user features:

Add:
1. Article filtering:
   - Category selection
   - Search functionality
   - View mode toggle (grid/list/compact)

2. State management:
   - React Query for API state
   - Zustand for UI state
   - Local storage for user preferences

3. User features:
   - Bookmark articles
   - View mode persistence
   - Responsive design improvements
```

### Phase 3: AI Analysis Pipeline
```markdown
Add AI analysis features to the news aggregator:
Do thie INCREMENTALLY ONLY, and start with just the sentiment analysis
Never attempt to do this all at once

Backend:
1. Create AI service with:
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Readability scoring
   - Content classification
   - Basic bias detection
2. Enhance article endpoint to include analysis
3. Add in-memory caching for AI results

Frontend:
1. Update article cards to show:
   - Sentiment badges
   - Readability level
   - Content type (news/opinion)
2. Add loading states for analysis
3. Implement error handling for AI features
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features and Optimization
```markdown
Complete the news aggregator with advanced features:

1. Enhanced AI:
   - Key quote extraction
   - Keyword generation
   - Topic clustering
   - Trending topics

2. Performance:
   - Image optimization
   - Lazy loading
   - Infinite scroll
   - Route prefetching

3. User Experience:
   - Article detail pages
   - Share functionality
   - Theme switching
   - Accessibility improvements

4. Error Handling:
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Fallback UI
   - Error boundaries
   - Network error recovery
```

### Phase 5: Frontent animation enhancements
```markdown
cool front end animation library to apply as a hover over effect on the news article

1. Frontend effects:
   - Use framer-motion library
   - Slightly lift the card
   - Add a smooth scale effect
   - Add a subtle rotation
   - Enhance the shadow effect
```

## Performance Targets

- Page Load Time: < 2s
- Time to Interactive: < 3s
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Lighthouse Score: > 90
- API Response Time: < 500ms
- AI Analysis Time: < 2s per article
